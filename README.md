# Free Coding Interview Questions for Everyone

An open alternative for commercial websites.

### Entirely and Forever Free

To ensure this project will be free forever:

* We make the entire data set open source.
* We provide a local web tool to allow you to do the exercises locally.
* We provide a command to generate jupyter notebooks for exercises.

If you decided to do the exercises locally, we encourage you to start with forking our repository.
